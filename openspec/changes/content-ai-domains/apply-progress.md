## PR 1 — Migration + Frontend Contract (Phase 1, tasks 1.1-1.6)

Status: Complete.

Zero Gemini dependency. Adds the `short_description` column (D3/DD10's short
catalog blurb, additive alongside the existing `description` long body) and
pins it into the frontend's read contract. No write path, no rendering
behavior yet — those land in later PRs (2, 3, 4).

### Files changed

- `backend/tests/integration/db/test_rls_policies.py` — new test
  `test_restricted_role_reads_short_description_null_on_existing_row`,
  parametrized over `anon`/`authenticated`, proving the column is selectable
  from `catalog_products` and reads back `null` on a pre-existing row.
- `supabase/migrations/20260817000000_products_short_description.sql` (new)
  — `alter table products add column short_description text;` +
  `create or replace view catalog_products` appending the column after
  `created_at` (DD7: append-only, preserves the `anon`/`authenticated`
  grants issued in `20260810000458_public_catalog_rls.sql`).
- `frontend/src/lib/catalog/columns.test.ts` — extended the existing
  column-list assertion to require `short_description`.
- `frontend/src/lib/catalog/columns.ts` — `CATALOG_PRODUCT_COLUMNS` now
  includes `short_description`.
- `frontend/src/lib/catalog/types.ts` — `CatalogProductRow` gains
  `short_description: string | null`.

### Verification (independently re-run by orchestrator)

- `uv run pytest backend/tests/integration/db/test_rls_policies.py -v`
  (local Supabase Postgres, `DB_URL` set) — 66 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- `npm --prefix frontend test` — 47 files, 344 tests passed.
- Migration schema state confirmed directly against the local Postgres
  container (`\d products`, `\d catalog_products`) — column and view both
  match the migration file.

### Notes

- The local Supabase Postgres volume already had this migration's DDL
  applied from before an earlier interrupted apply session (schema matched,
  but `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` had no tracked entry for
  `20260817000000` — a CLI bookkeeping gap only, not a schema drift; `npx
  supabase migration up` correctly reported "already exists" on the `alter
  table`, confirming the DB state, not a conflict).
- Rollback boundary (per tasks.md's Suggested Work Units table): revert the
  migration file + the `create or replace view` back to
  `20260811000000`'s definition, and revert `columns.ts`/`types.ts`; no
  later unit depends on this column carrying a value yet.
